# Using Slipstream Wii
Slipstream Wii is used to create (.sample.szs) files, special (.szs) files that store models, animations, vehicles, textures, and the name of a driver in Mario Kart Wii. Using extracted files, Slipstream Wii can create character samples which can be edited through Brawlbox or Brawlcrate. With one or more edited sample files, Slipstream Wii can turn the sample files back into a collection of edited Mario Kart Wii files which can be put back into the game through programs like Riivolution.
